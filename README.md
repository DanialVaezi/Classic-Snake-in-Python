# Classic-Snake-in-Python
--- SUMMARY --
- I created the classic Snake game with python with the help of an online introductory course to python. 
- Link to course: https://open.hpi.de/courses/pythonjunior-schule2022
- I made use of the "turtle" library in python for base of the game. 
- All the logic and functions are in one file and can be easily downloaded and run. 

--- INSTALLATION --

- Your local device should have python installed. If not download from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Download the entire .zip file.
- Unzip it and run the "snake-finalversion.py" file, with python.
- If you cannot find python, search for IDLE in your windows start menu and open it manually from there.
