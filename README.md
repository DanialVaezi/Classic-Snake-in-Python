# Classic-Snake-in-Python
--- SUMMARY --
- I created the classic Snake game with python with the help of an online introductory course to python. 
- Link to course: https://open.hpi.de/courses/pythonjunior-schule2022
- I made use of the "turtle" library in python for base of the game. 
- All the logic and functions are in one file and can be easily downloaded and run.
